Tauri lets you enhance your frontend with native capabilities. We call these [Commands][command], essentially Rust functions that you can call from your frontend JavaScript. This enables you to handle heavy processing or calls to the OS in much more performant Rust code.

Let's make a simple example:

```rust title=src-tauri/src/main.rs
#[tauri::command]
fn greet(name: &str) -> String {
   format!("Hello, {}!", name)
}
```

A Command is just like any regular Rust function, with the addition of the `#[tauri::command]` attribute macro that allows your function to communicate with the JavaScript context.

Lastly, we also need to tell Tauri about our newly created command so that it can route calls accordingly. This is done with the combination of the `.invoke_handler()` function and the `generate_handler![]` macro you can see below:

```rust title=src-tauri/src/main.rs
fn main() {
  tauri::Builder::default()
  // highlight-next-line
    .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![greet])
    .run(tauri::generate_context!())
    .expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

Now you're ready to call your Command from the frontend!
